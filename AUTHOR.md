### Dedication

*To the engineers who have been woken up at 3:00 AM by a PagerDuty alert caused by a distributed transaction that wasn't.*

*And to the architects who understand that the most important lines on a diagram are not the boxes, but the empty spaces between them where the network lives.*

*"The goal is not to build the perfect architecture, but to build an architecture that can evolve toward perfection."* — Viquar Khan
