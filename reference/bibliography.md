## Industry Patterns & Anti-Patterns

139. **The Nano-Swarm Anti-Pattern**: 200+ services for medium-sized applications. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 1.
    - Symptom: Network overhead exceeds business logic execution time
    - Impact: Deployment coordination becomes impossible
    - Example: Simple "create order" operation touching 15 services

140. **The Distributed Monolith**: Services deployed separately but tightly coupled. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 1.
    - Symptom: Lock-step deployments, shared database, chatty interfaces
    - Impact: Worst of both worlds - distributed complexity without benefits
    - Mathematical Reality: System availability = 0.999^50 ≈ 95.1%

141. **The God Service**: Single service with excessive responsibility. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 1.
    - Symptom: 50,000+ lines of code, high cyclomatic complexity
    - Impact: Cognitive overload, multiple teams touching same service
    - Solution: Extract bounded contexts using Adaptive Granularity Strategy

142. **The Pinball Architecture**: Choreography gone wrong. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 5.
    - Symptom: Events bouncing between services, impossible to debug
    - Impact: No visibility into workflow state, "ghost outages"
    - Solution: Migrate to orchestration when complexity exceeds threshold

143. **The Death Spiral**: Retry storms in event-driven systems. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 5.
    - Symptom: Aggressive retries during system overload
    - Impact: Positive feedback loop causing cascading failures
    - Mitigation: Exponential backoff, jitter, circuit breakers, DLQ

144. **The Zombie Record**: Dual write failure mode A. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 6.
    - Symptom: Database commit succeeds, event publication fails
    - Impact: Order exists but downstream services never notified
    - Solution: Transactional Outbox pattern

145. **The Ghost Message**: Dual write failure mode B. *Anti-Pattern*, Chapter 6.
    - Symptom: Event published, database transaction rolls back
    - Impact: Shipping label printed for non-existent order
    - Solution: Transactional Outbox pattern
